      Co-branded credit cards that are backed by a payment-processing network such as Visa can be used anywhere the payment network is accepted. 
        In this research, however, we find that consumers often use co-branded credit cards in a restricted manner. Using data from credit card statements and scenario experiments, 
        we show that consumers are less willing to use a reward-maximizing credit card if it is co-branded with a merchant brand that does not fit with the purchase brand. 
        We identify two mechanisms. First, the featured brand on a co-branded credit card produces assumptions about the card’s reward structure, 
        and those assumptions limit consumers’ attention to the actual reward structure. Second, the featured brand on a co-branded credit card leads some purchases outside of the featured brand to feel like a bad “fit.” 
        Co-branded credit cards represent a significant share of credit card companies’ product offerings. This research sheds light on when and why consumers are reluctant to use co-branded credit cards broadly, 
        offering managerial insights that could help credit card companies refine their strategies for co-branded products as well as help consumers maximize their credit card rewards.
